Hi 👋

I'm [Emma](https://github.com/Emmanuellecode).

👗👖✂  After having worked as a tailor for some luxury houses for more than 10 years, I undertook a professional reconversion. 💎

💾 IT has always attracted me, I chose to move towards the web developer profession more particularly towards the front 🖥️

🌿🐳 My passion being scuba diving. I am sensitive about the ecological impact in the web environment. I regularly learn about the eco-responsible practices to put in place to work more environmentally friendly. 🌍🍃
