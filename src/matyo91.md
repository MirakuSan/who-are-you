Hi 👋

I'm [Mathieu](https://github.com/matyo91).

I like Computer 💻 and Internet 🌎 that bring knowledge 💡 and creation 🚀 for relatively no cost 💶 or energy ⚡️.

What I can contribute is about exploring Tiny Design Mechanics ⚙️ as Processing, Generating, Rendering, Filtering, Solving things that are more relevant to Web and Games.

If you are interested, have a look at my blog 📝 : [https://blog.darkwood.fr/](https://blog.darkwood.fr/)
